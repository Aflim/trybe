        <p>Eyes are testaments to evolution’s creativity. They all do the same basic things—detect light, and convert it into electrical signals—but in such a wondrous variety of ways. There are single and compound eyes, bifocal lenses and rocky ones, mirrors and optic fibres. And there are eyes that are so alien, so constantly surprising, that after decades of research, scientists have only just about figured out how they work, let alone why they evolved that way. To find them, you need to go for a swim.</p>

        <p>Here’s an analogy: say you’ve got a big crowd lining up in front of six security guards, each of whom must shout out when they spot someone with a specific name. One recognises Adams, another targets Bobs, and so on. But the guards aren’t too bright; they wouldn’t know Adam if he introduced himself. So you make their job easier. You rig the queuing system so that only Adams line up in front of Adam-blocking guard, only Bobs reaching the Bob-blocker, and so on. The guards shout pretty much indiscriminately, but they still do their jobs correctly. They’re not specific; you impose specificity onto them.
  
          That’s exactly what happens in the mantis shrimp’s eye. When light enters the units in its eye, it must first pass through a crystalline cone, which lies over the receptors. Bok found that these cones contain UV-blocking substances called MAAs (or mycosporine-like amino acids, in full). There are four, possibly five, of these, which block slightly different wavelengths of UV. Combine these filters with the two underlying opsins, and you get six different classes of UV receptor.
          
          Many marine animals have one or two MAAs. They use these as sunscreens to block UV from reaching their skin and eyes, and causing damage that could eventually lead to cancer. The mantis shrimps also use MAAs to block UV but for a unique purpose: to turn their eyes into incredibly sophisticated UV detectors.
          
          Where do the MAAs come from? It’s not clear. No animal can make these chemicals themselves, so they must get them from their environment, possibly from their diet or from microbes. But two of the MAAs that Bok discovered have never been seen before, so it’s possible that the mantis shrimps can somehow change any incoming MAAs into five different types.
          
          “We presented these results last summer at a big vision conference and one of my colleagues said: Now, you’ve solved all the problems. What are you going to do next?” says Tom Cronin, who led the study. “We sort of feel that way. The big problem now is: What does this all have to do with vision?” Why do mantis shrimps have such ridiculously complicated eyes? That’s the big question, and no one really knows.
          
          The team are now trying to study how mantis shrimps react to different UV signals. For example, they find some short wavelengths of UV so repulsive that they’ll avoid food that’s paired with those wavelengths. Maybe this has something to do with aggressive signals? Mantis shrimps have rich social lives and they might communicate with ultraviolet patterns reflecting off their bodies.</p>

          <p>O camarão-louva-a-deus-palhaço (Odontodactylus scyllarus), também conhecido como lagosta-boxeadora é uma espécie de tamarutaca nativa do Indo-Pacífico, de Guam até a África Oriental. Em aquários de água salgada, é uma atração tanto pela coloração quanto pelo perigo.</p>

              <h3>Referencias biologicas</h3>
              <p>Esses animais possuem o mais complexo sistema de visão de cores do mundo animal, pois enxergam 12 cores primárias, correspondentes aos 12 pigmentos distintos presentes em sua retina.

                Nossos olhos possuem três tipos desses receptores - que correspondem à luz azul, verde e vermelha -, que nos permitem perceber o espectro de cores que vemos. Os cães contam com apenas dois tipos de cones (verde e azul), e é por isso que eles vêm tons de azul, verde e um pouco de amarelo. Muitos anfíbios, répteis, aves e insetos possuem quatro tipo de cones, o que significa que espécies dessas classes conseguem ver cores que o nosso cérebro é incapaz de processar. Algumas espécies específicas de borboletas e possivelmente pombos possuem cinco cones de percepção de cor, o que aumenta ainda mais a quantidade de pigmentos que eles são capazes de perceber. O sistema de visão dos estomatópodes possui doze cones sensíveis à luz e outros quatro que filtram a luz (16 cones no total), o que lhes permite ver cores polarizadas e imagens multiespectrais.[6]</p>
